The treatment of a patient with a radioactive material termed a radiopharmaceutical that targets cancer or other aberrant, sick cells is known as radiopharmaceutical therapy (also known as molecular radiotherapy or "targeted" radionuclide therapy). Because the radiopharmaceutical selectively irradiates and destroys cancer cells while limiting radiation exposure to healthy tissue, this treatment is known as "targeted" radionuclide therapy. A radioactive atom (also known as a radionuclide) is paired with a targeting molecule that selectively seeks and binds to, in, or near cancer cells in radiopharmaceuticals. Without the use of a targeting molecule, some radionuclides can target specific cells. Because thyroid and thyroid cancer tissues naturally digest radioactive iodine, physicians have utilised radioiodine to safely treat hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland) and some types of thyroid cancer for many years. Because therapy may be adjusted to fit the molecular features of a patient's individual tumour, targeted radionuclide therapy holds promise for personalised treatment of many forms of cancer. Furthermore, because the radiopharmaceutical is delivered by the circulatory system, it can be used to treat tumours all throughout the body, including cancer that has spread to the point of being metastatic. On the other hand, surgery and external-beam radiation therapy (also known as teletherapy) can only remove malignancies from the treatment site, not from other parts of the body.

Patients are given radionuclides in nuclear medicine treatments for a range of diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The absorbed dosage to diverse organs of the patient is a critical consideration in such research; this concern is naturally heightened in therapeutic applications, where a large absorbed dose may be received by other organs, especially radiosensitive organs.

"Dosimetry" alludes to the science by which radiation not entirely settled by estimation, computation, or a mix of estimation and computation. The specialized name for radiation portion is "consumed portion"; it is how much radiation energy that is saved in tissue partitioned by the mass of the tissue. The consumed portion is the main actual element that impacts the reaction of cancers and the remainder of the body to radiation.
\par
Assimilated portion decides the degree to which cancers and typical tissues are impacted by radiation. The higher the consumed portion to growths, the more cells will be killed by radiation and the more noteworthy the probability of a fix. Be that as it may, the higher the consumed portion to typical tissues, the almost certain and extreme might be the unfortunate harmful results of the radiation. A significant benefit of radiopharmaceutical treatment is its capacity to light and viably treat growths all through the body; simultaneously, a few illumination of typical organs is unavoidable. Hence, the job of radiation dosimetry in designated radionuclide treatment is to decide explicitly, for every tolerant, the directed measure of the radiopharmaceutical that will most viably treat the patient's sickness while staying away from ingested dosages that harm typical tissues. Individualized radiation dosimetry is basic for arranging the best and most secure designated radionuclide treatment for every tolerant.
